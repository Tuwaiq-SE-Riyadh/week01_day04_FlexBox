        <div class="child ">This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
            be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
            favorites as well!

            <h1>Directions</h1>
            <div class="child ">
                <p>
                    1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
                    C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
                    to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
                    slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
                    that it does not run off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
                    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
