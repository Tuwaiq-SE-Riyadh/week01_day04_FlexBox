        Apple Pies This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
          be my favorite and has, won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
          favorites as well!<br><center>

         <p>Directions</p> 
        <br> 1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
        C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
        to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. 
        <br>2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
        slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
        that it does not run off. 
        <br>3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</div>
